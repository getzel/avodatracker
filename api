//List User's Tasks, with Streaks
SELECT * FROM users_tasks
JOIN tasks ON tasks.ID = task_ID
WHERE user_ID = :user_ID

Figuring out streaks is Tricky! Here's one attempt at the daily schedule type. The idea is: 
- Order by timestamp desc
- calculate how many days ago that stamp is
- generate a row number for each row
- return the first row number which does NOT match the days ago and Voila. In theory. 
NOTE: logs for the future should be blocked, obv.

(Haven't set up a populated db so I can't test this yet)

SET @row_number = 0; -- MySQL < 8 doesn't have row_number()
SELECT(@row_number:=@row_number + 1) AS `row_num`, datediff(NOW(),FROM_UNIXTIME(log_date)) days_ago FROM avoda_track.task_log
WHERE task_ID = :task_ID
AND @row_number <> datediff(NOW(),FROM_UNIXTIME(log_date))
ORDER BY `log_date` DESC LIMIT 0,1

Note: instead of dynamic calculation we can calculate on log entry and save streak number and date calculated and then show 0 if the date
is more than one day ago.
